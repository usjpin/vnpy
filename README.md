# VnPy Language
**Authors:** Utkarsh Singh, Jacob Caudill, David Li

This project contains all the files for the DSL Project - Vnpy. The project is written using Python 3 and the Pygame library.

## Requirements
Please have a version of Python 3.6+ installed. For all the examples/documentation, make sure to use the alias/path that calls the Python 3.6+ interpreter. We will be using `py` as our alias throughout the project.

## Documentation
The documentation/presentation of the project is hosted on: [https://vnpy-docs.herokuapp.com/](https://vnpy-docs.herokuapp.com/). If the web hosting documentation failes to load (Heroku goes down sometimes), please navigate and open to `/docs/public/index.html`. In-depth discussion of the language and grammar details are provided in the documentation.

## Installation
Installation of dependencies (pygame) can be done by running: `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Please keep in mind that you may have to use `pip3` instead of `pip` (for machines that have both Python 2.X and 3.X installed)

## Running Code
To run the program, simply use `py vn.py [filename]`.

## Sample Test Code
The sample test code discussed in the documentation are hosting in the `/sample_code` folder. Please use these examples from the root directory as: `py vn.py sample_code/<file_name>`.
